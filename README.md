# simple_shell project. Fredrick & Jerry
The shell undergoes 3 major tasks before executing a command
- *Initialize*: the shell reads set of configuration files
- *Interpret: Reads commands from `stdin` and executes them
- Terminate: After interpretation, the shell performs any shutdown commands, frees any memory and terminates the process.
